# CryptoSuit Smart Contract

This smart contract implements the CryptoSuit (CS) token, an ERC-721 token. It is a free and open standard that describes how to build non-fungible (or unique tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables.
